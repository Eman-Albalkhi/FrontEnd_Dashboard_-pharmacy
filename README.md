# FrontEnd_Dashboard_-pharmacy
A dashboard for a pharmacy is a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that provide a snapshot of the pharmacy's performance. It typically includes information about sales, inventory, customers, prescriptions, and employee performance. By using a dashboard, pharmacy owners and managers can quickly identify trends, track progress towards goals, and make data-driven decisions to improve the business.
